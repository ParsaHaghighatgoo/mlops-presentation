- **Canary Deployment**  
- **Blue-Green Deployment**  

###  Monitoring
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Fairness & bias detection  
- System metrics (latency, throughput, uptime)  

###  Applications in Healthcare
- AI in medical imaging, personalized medicine, and predictive analytics  
- How MLOps ensures **reliability, scalability, and safety**
